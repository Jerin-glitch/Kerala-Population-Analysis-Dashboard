# Kerala-Population-Analysis-Dashboard
This project is an interactive Excel dashboard created to visualize and analyze Kerala’s demographic and housing statistics based on official census data.
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built from Kerala’s official census data to provide deep insights into the state’s demographic and housing patterns. The dashboard is designed for researchers, policymakers, students, and data enthusiasts to explore trends in population distribution, gender ratios, density, and urban–rural composition across all districts of Kerala.

📊 Overview
The dashboard allows users to:
Compare urban vs. rural population statistics
Analyze gender ratio trends (male-to-female and female-to-male)
Visualize district-wise population density
Study housing patterns — inhibited vs. uninhibited units
View state contribution metrics for each district’s share of the total population

📂 Dataset
The dataset is based on Kerala census data and contains:
State, district, and sub-district codes and names
Urban/Rural classification
Number of households, population counts (total, male, female)
Area in square kilometers
Population density per sq. km.
Housing unit inhabitation status

Data Preparation Steps:
Imported census Excel sheets into Excel
Cleaned and standardized column names and formats
Transformed raw values for better visualization
Created calculated columns and measures for ratios and density

⚙️ Features in the Dashboard
Urban and Rural Comparison: Side-by-side charts showing distribution of population and households.
Gender Analysis: Ratio visuals for male-to-female and female-to-male across districts.
Density Mapping: Identified high-density and low-density areas using charts and maps.
Housing Insights: Breakdown of inhibited vs. uninhibited units per region.
Contribution Analysis: Pie and bar charts showing each district’s percentage of the total state population.
